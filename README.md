# Virtue CI

Virtue is a bot for continuous integration that lets you keep your repositories under control and automate common actions. Virtue has
the benefit of being entirely under your control and very customizable. You run it on your own server and it will perform many tasks,
such as:

* Compiling and checking for errors
* Automatically running unit tests
* Running scripts on new commits

Virtue is still in development, and these features are not complete.
